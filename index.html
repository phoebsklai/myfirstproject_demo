<h3 style="font-family:Verdana;">About me!</h3>
<p style="color:Purple;">I'm currently a first year at NYU majoring in Integrated Design and Media!</p>
<h4 style="font-family:Verdana;">The start of my interest in design-</h4>
<p style="color:Red;">Taking AP Psycology my senior year of high school, I became fasicnated with the human brain. It has helped me understand that emotions and expectations can shape people's everyday decisions. Years of ideating digital flyers for my schools class council have opened my eyes to just how those emotional appeals operate in the real world, introducing me to the intersection between psychology, cognitive science, and technology. From forecasting a user's journey, UX Design plays on a users' digital interactions and decison making abilities, all of which I have found myself gravitating towards because of my AP Psychology course.</p>

<<h4 style="font-family:Verdana;">Fun Facts-</h4>
<p style="color:green;">I used to play golf, I enjoy volunteering, I used to be on a competitve dance team called Syndikidz, and I'm a big Marvel Fan.</p>
